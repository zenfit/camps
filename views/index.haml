      students currently enrolled in our Zen Youth program is <strong>$500 for the mini-week</strong> or <strong>$400 early bird</strong> (sign-up before June 1st)
      for camp.  We will offer payment plans for current students and families for their dedication and support of our dojo.

      Pre paid Tuition payments must be made before the 1st of June. Full payments are expected regardless of actual attendance 
      and/or holidays.  The cost structure of our program is based on this assumption. Please consider that you are receiving
